    <h3>
        PHP is widely used for server-side web development, when a website frequently requests information from a server. As an older language, PHP benefits from a large ecosystem of users who have produced frameworks, libraries, and automation tools to make the programming language easier to use. PHP code is also easy to debug. PHP is the code running content-oriented websites such as Facebook, WordPress, and Wikipedia.
