    <h3>
        Python continues to be one of the best programming languages every developer should learn this year. The language is easy-to-learn and offers a clean and well-structured code, making it powerful enough to build a decent web application.
    </h3>
    <h3>
        Python can be used for web and desktop applications, GUI-based desktop applications, machine learning, data science, and network servers. The programming language enjoys immense community support and offers several open-source libraries, frameworks, and modules that make application development a cakewalk.
    </h3>
    <h3>
        For instance, Python offers Django and Flask, popular libraries for web development and TensorFlow, Keras, and SciPy for data science applications.
    </h3>
    <h3>
        Though Python has been around for a while, it makes sense to learn this language in 2020 as it can help you get a job or a freelance project quickly, thereby accelerating your career growth.
